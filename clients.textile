h1. Other jark clients 

h2. Emacs

We are working on a "slime-nrepl client":https://github.com/icylisper/slime-nrepl . It is still in very early development.
But for now, one can start a swank instance and connect from emacs.
To start the swank server do <code>client> jark swank start [--port]</code>.
To connect from emacs: <code>M-x slime-connect 127.0.0.1 [4005]</code>

When writing clojure scripts using jark, add the following to .emacs to recognise it as clojure-mode.

{% highlight cl %}
(add-to-list 'interpreter-mode-alist '("jark" . clojure-mode))
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Vim

Hope someone writes a nrepl-client for vim!

h2. Android client

Coming soon in 0.4 release.
