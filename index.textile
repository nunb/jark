h2. Why Jark

Startup time of the Java Virtual Machine(JVM) is quite slow and thereby command-line applications on the JVM are sluggish and very painful to use. Jark is an attempt to run a persistent JVM daemon and provide a set of utilities to control and operate on it. 

Jark is intended to 
* deploy, maintain and debug clojure programs on remote hosts
* provide an easy interface to run clojure programs from the command-line
* provide a nailgun replacement that is secure, lightweight and clojure-aware
