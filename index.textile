h2. Jark

Startup time of the Java Virtual Machine(JVM) is quite slow and thereby command-line applications on the JVM are sluggish and very painful to use. Jark is an attempt to run a persistent JVM daemon and provide a set of utilities to control and operate on it. 

Jark is intended to 
* deploy, maintain and debug clojure programs on remote hosts
* provide an easy interface to run clojure programs on the command-line
* provide a set of useful namespace and classpath utilities 
* provide a thin client that can run on any OS platform and with minimum runtime dependencies.
