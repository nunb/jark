h2. VM utils

To list all the threads that are running on the VM:
<pre class="terminal"><code>$ jark vm threads</code></pre>

We can switch between different instances of the JVM running on different hosts. By default it connects to localhost on port 2113.
<pre class="terminal"><code>$ jark vm connect [--host] [--port]</code></pre>

To get the memory usage and other stats of the VM:
<pre class="terminal"><code>$ jark vm stat
=> VM port     -   2113
   swank port  -   4005
   total mem   -   170 MB
   used mem    -   20 MB
   free mem    -   150 MB
   start time  -   Tue Apr 05 16:24:33 IST 2011
   uptime      -   1m | 117s
</code></pre>

To do garbage collection on demand.
<pre class="terminal"><code>$ jark vm gc</code></pre>

The VM module currently uses nailgun which has serious limitations.
There is a new module called nrepl that would eventually provide nailgun's functionality and more.
It uses Chas Emerick's "nrepl":https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl

<pre class="terminal"><code>jark nrepl start [--port] (defaults to 9000)
jark nrepl connect [--host ] [--port] : to test connection
jark nrepl send [--host] [--port] --expression EXPRESSION
eg: $ jark nrepl send -e "(take 6 (iterate inc 1))"
    => (1 2 3 4 5 6)
</code></pre>




In the future, jark would support other Virtual Machines that clojure runs on, apart from the JVM.
