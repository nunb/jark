h1. Using jark in IDEs and editors

One of the goals of jark is to support IDEs and editors written in non-JVM languages to communicate with the JVM with ease and speed. Also jark has very minimum runtime dependencies and can run on most platforms. There is currently effort on providing Lua, OCaml and Bash API to extend jark.
